Program for encryption and decryption. 

At the beginning the user acesses a menu where he has to make the first choice between encrypting, decrypting or exiting the program. 

After this he/she/it has to enter a passwort which is used as an shiftcode (code which says how the variables get shifted)

The sentence is shifted with the respective factor and is output. When selecting decryption, the password is 
also entered first and then the sentence to be decrypted. The output is the encrypted or decrypted text. 

If the user decides to quit, the program shuts down.
